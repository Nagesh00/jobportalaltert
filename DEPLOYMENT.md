## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Bot Status
- Go to **Actions** tab to see execution history
- Green checkmark = successful run
- Red X = failed run (click to see error details)

### Common Issues

**No emails received:**
- Check spam folder
- Verify Gmail app password is correct
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail

**Workflow fails:**
- Check if secrets are set correctly
- Look at error logs in Actions tab
- Ensure repository is public for free Actions

**Too many/few results:**
- Adjust keywords in `is_relevant_job()` function
- Modify experience keywords
- Change country list

### View Tracked Jobs
The bot saves all found jobs in `tracked_jobs.json` in your repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

- **Frequency:** Runs every 6 hours automatically
- **Coverage:** 5+ countries simultaneously  
- **Filtering:** Only relevant software testing jobs with 2-6 years experience
- **Notifications:** HTML-formatted emails with job details
- **Tracking:** Prevents duplicate notifications

## ðŸ“ˆ Usage Statistics

After deployment, you can monitor:
- Number of jobs found per run (in Actions logs)
- Countries with most opportunities
- Success rate of email delivery
- Total jobs tracked over time

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes
