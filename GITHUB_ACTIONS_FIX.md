# 🔧 GitHub Actions Permission Fix

## ✅ Fixed Issues:

1. **Added explicit permissions** to the workflow:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write
   ```

2. **Added GITHUB_TOKEN** to the checkout and push steps
3. **Updated workflow** to use proper authentication

## 🔍 What was the problem?

The GitHub Actions workflow was getting a **403 Permission Denied** error when trying to push changes back to the repository. This happened because:

- GitHub Actions needs explicit permission to write to the repository
- The default permissions are read-only for security
- The workflow needs to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication

## ✅ What was fixed:

### Before (causing errors):
```yaml
jobs:
  monitor-jobs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### After (working):
```yaml
jobs:
  monitor-jobs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## 🚀 Additional Setup Required:

### 1. **Repository Settings** (You may need to check these):
   - Go to your repository → Settings → Actions → General
   - Under "Workflow permissions", ensure:
     - ✅ "Read and write permissions" is selected
     - ✅ "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" (if needed)

### 2. **Add Required Secrets**:
   Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions and add:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: 8305949318:AAF257TSUv4EObGWLAAi7Cq7K87iambC9EM
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID: 6411380646
   SENDER_EMAIL: your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD: your-gmail-app-password
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL: your-email@gmail.com
   ```

## 🧪 Testing:

1. **Manual Test**: Go to Actions → "Job Monitor (Alternative Sources + Telegram)" → "Run workflow"
2. **Check Output**: The workflow should now complete without permission errors
3. **Verify**: New jobs will be committed to `tracked_jobs_alt.json` automatically

## 📱 Expected Behavior:

- ✅ Workflow runs every 6 hours automatically
- ✅ Finds new jobs using alternative sources (RemoteOK API)
- ✅ Sends Telegram notifications to your chat
- ✅ Commits job data back to repository
- ✅ No more permission errors!

## 🔧 If you still get permission errors:

1. Check repository workflow permissions (Settings → Actions → General)
2. Verify the repository is not private with restricted permissions
3. Ensure you have admin access to the repository

Your job monitoring bot is now ready for production! 🎉
